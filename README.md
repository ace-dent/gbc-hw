# gbc-hw

A collection of information on the Game Boy Color (CGB) hardware:

- [gbc-census](/gbc-census) – Data on the devices in circulation.

I welcome feedback and suggestions, to continue improving the project for everyone. It really motivates me that people enjoy my work. Please keep the data gnomes fed with a [star](https://github.com/ace-dent/gbc-hw/stargazers)! ⭐️

For the census, please state your country and check the following:
- [ ] **Back photo**: Attach a photo clearly showing the serial number (e.g. `CG123456789`) and the production identifier (e.g. `C/CGB-JPN-2`) on the larger rear sticker. 📷
- [ ] **PCB photo**: Attach photo(s) to show the revision number (e.g. `05`) and PCB panel numbers (e.g. `1-2`), under the battery terminal on the lower left side. This can be seen by opening the battery cover and tilting the unit, but can be tricky to photograph. 🔍
- [ ] **Special edition photos** (optional): If your unit is a Special Edition shell, include extra photographs that show the front and any relevant details. ✨

If you feel comfortable opening the device, photos of the front and rear of the main circuit board are also very helpful! 🙏

# gbc-census

A census of Game Boy Color devices. This data was manually scraped over a few years.

<hr>

The data is sorted by serial number and split by prefix into four CSV files:
- `C` series: Made in Japan, distributed in Japan and internationally ([here](gbc-census-C.csv)).
- `CG` series: Made in Japan and China for North America ([here](gbc-census-CG.csv)).
- `CH` series: Made in China, distributed internationally ([here](gbc-census-CH.csv)).
- `X` series: Promotional units ([here](gbc-census-X.csv)).  

I welcome feedback and suggestions, to continue improving the project for everyone. It really motivates me that people enjoy my work. Please keep the data gnomes fed with a [star](https://github.com/ace-dent/gbc-hw/stargazers)! ⭐️
